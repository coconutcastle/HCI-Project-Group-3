            No benchmark tasks were given as part of the evaluation plan, though usability goals 1 and 5 were generally
            achieved, though exceptions such as User 3 exist.. Usability goals 3, 4, and 7 could not be evaluated as
            they related to the functionality of the system. Users struggled with the remaining usability goals, 2 and
            6, due to lack of clarity of what the buttons were supposed to do as well as confusion with the wording of
            the tasks. Task 3 failed most often due to the wording issue, as users did not understand that they were
            already on the selection page, while tasks 4 and 5 were sometimes executed with difficulty and required
            prompting. These will be explained in further detail in the next section.

        <div class="header2Text">Test Plan Critique</div>
        <div class="text">
            Expanding on some test procedure wording issues mentioned in the previous section, one of the major issues
            with the test plan was with the task list users were expected to complete. Users frequently found it
            difficult to understand what the task was asking of them, especially when combined with some broken
            prototype components. There were two tasks that seemed to cause particular difficulty. The first is “confirm
            your choice”, which appears in the wording for tasks 2 and 4. There was no “confirm button”, and simply
            selecting the song seemed insufficient, so many pressed the “start singing” button and moved onto the next
            page. The second is “go back to the selection screen”. Users did not seem to understand that they were
            already on the selection screen, and a few tried navigating to other pages to find it. This task could
            likely be removed entirely as it has little to do with the interface and to avoid causing confusion.
            <br><br>
            We also had difficulty administering the post-test questionnaire. This is mainly because many of the
            questions were focused on the intended functionality of the system, which is not present in the prototype.
            Users did not know how to answer questions 1, 2, and 6, as they assumed that the user was actually able to
            use the prototype for its singing functionality. These questions do relate to usability goals 3, 4, and 7,
            but our group has difficulty understanding the relevance of these goals considering how they don’t address
            the usability of the interface and that they are used to evaluate a simple prototype.
            <br><br>
            Continuing with the post-test questionnaire, users were also unclear by what was meant by “parts of the
            prototype”, unsure if they were supposed to be commenting on its supposed functionality or interface
            components, which we had to explain. We would recommend adding more questions that focused on the user’s
            experience navigating and using the prototype, giving it a numerical grade, and seeing if they would
            recommend it to others.
            <br><br>
            In the test script, we would recommend making it very clear to the user that they are not being evaluated on
            their performance. User 1 became visibly stressed over her confusion and started randomly clicking buttons,
            and had to be assuaged by the evaluator. We would also make it more obvious that this is a prototype, not a
            fully functional system, as some users became confused over buttons not working as expected. This required
            for us to modify the test script for the following users, reiterating upon these points.
            <br><br>
            Overall, while the test procedure and materials related well to the stated usability goals, our group is
            doubtful of their applicability for this particular deliverable. Many tasks and user materials could also be
            reworded, to make questions and the purpose of the tasks clearer.

            Lastly, there are some cosmetic issues brought up by individual users that can potentially be addressed,
            though they were not widespread enough for us to consider as usability issues. User 2 found the lines
            indicating pitch “ugly and squiggly”, though this sentiment was not expressed by other users. User 2 also
            suggested making the blue line green in the reporting screen to make it clearer that this was the correct
            pitch, and that it was hard to tell whether to follow the blocked-pitch approximation or the line.
