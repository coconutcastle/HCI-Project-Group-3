      Based on feedback from informal user tests and previous plans, we have made the following modifications to the
      system.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Added a “Delete Semester” button.</b> Previously, the ability to delete added semesters was not present
          in the prototype. We did not realize it would be an issue until some users made mistakes inputting the year
          when adding semesters, and could not undo it.</li>
        <li><b>Added a “Remove Course” button.</b> Similar to the “Delete Semester” button, this gives a user added
          control over the state of their course progress. </li>
        <li><b>Added functionality to the side menu such that it could be closed by clicking outside of it.</b> This was
          for increased convenience of navigability and site consistency, as other modals could be closed by clicking
          outside of it. Some users attempted to click outside the side menu before realizing they had to move the
          cursor back to the menu button, which some disliked.</li>
        <li><b>Added a button that allows the user update course state.</b> Course states were previously hard-coded
          into the system, but this new update gives users more control over the state of their course progress. The
          previous version only reflected the initial conditions of the user’s degree progress.</li>
        <li><b>Made the view programs buttons drop-down accordions.</b> This allows the user to click through all the
          degree options without needing to click the back button if they made a mistake. While in the process of
          implementing changes, we were often frustrated with needing to click the back button so much when just wanting
          to check if the buttons were working.</li>
        <li><b>Completed the “Profile” page with improved error handling and updating functionality.</b> This increases
          the amount of control users have over their own accounts and gives them improved flexibility for their own
          usage. This also improves the security of their accounts by hiding passwords and making sure emails are valid.
        </li>
        <li><b>Set a site palette.</b> Previously, some imported components, while functional, did not fit into the
          established aesthetic of the site and stuck out due to their lack of consistency. Style overrides were made to
          ensure this would not be the case.</li>
        <li><b>Added a confirmation modal.</b> For state modifications that included deleting a large amount of objects,
          a confirmation modal was added to insert an extra step into the process in case a user clicked a button they
          did not mean to or changed their mind. This problem was noticed when a user accidentally clicked the “Delete
          Semester” button instead of the “Add Course” button, given the two’s close proximity.</li>
        <li><b>Changed the seasons in the “Add Semester” modal to a button group.</b> Considering that there are only
          three options, there was no need to put the different season options into a select drop down. This reduces the
          number of clicks a user needs to add a new semester.</li>
        <li><b>Limited the height of the “View Requirements Modal”.</b> While the previous version had the same
          functionality, it was inconsistent with the style of the other modals by superceding the length of the window,
          and was also far less pleasing to look at and scroll through because of it. The height was limited and a
          scrollbar was added to improve this.</li>
        <li><b>Added a site fallback.</b> A bug was discovered for users who logged out and then tried to use the back
          button. As they were logged out, they could no longer access some pages, and this was expressed in the iste as
          a 404 error. To avoid this, we set up the landing page as a fallback and made it so that logged out users
          could only navigate between the landing page and programs page.</li>
      </ul>

      The McGill ECSE Degree Visualizer began as a project to meet the needs of current and prospective McGill ECSE
      students. The current reality for students is that information regarding course curriculums is sprawled across
      many webpages and can be challenging to track down. Degree requirements, course pre-requisites and minor program
      entry requirements are just some examples of information that students need but often are unable to find on their
      own or end up being misinformed. Additionally, students are individually responsible to keep track of their degree
      progression as they go through their degrees. We set out to bridge the gap between the offerings by McGill and
      students' needs. The usability goals that we identified earlier on in the process were discoverability,
      reliability/maintainability, and user satisfaction. It was imperative that users be able to easy understand all of
      the functionality of the system. As seen in the beta system, we evolved to a system with more functionality
      exposed to the user. There is less hidden away in menus.
      <br><br>
      Additionally, users can access relevant information involving course offerings without having to create a profile.
      This was important for us from the beginning because some users would not necessarily need to plan out their
      course selection and would still like to access information about the different curriculums. Our second usability
      goal revolved around reliability. The information that we used in the web app comes from McGill. Students need to
      be well informed and trust that the information they are using to plan their degree is up to date and accurate.
      (See future plans for more on this). Finally the third main targeted usability goal was user satisfaction. We
      wanted users to have an improved experience using our web app in comparison to what they were going through using
      solely McGill websites. Through our user testing, we were able to see the value added by our system to the user
      experience of looking up information ab out ECSE programs at McGill and we created a more structured way of
      planning the degree courses chosen. The beta prototype was able to achieve our gaols and create an enjoyable
      experience for users. The landing page is usable for those with and without accounts. The degree visualizer
      empowers students to plan their degree and keep track of their degree progress.
      <br><br>
      Future plans include added support for more courses. As of right now, we only have support for Electrical
      Engineering, though the system is already configured to support more. We would also like to add support for more
      minors. This all comes with an increased degree of independence from the McGill website, as currently, our website
      depends on data manually scraped from the pages, something we found difficult to automate due to lack of
      consistency on a page. This will involve a larger backend and deployment of our own databases to hold from the
      data in the McGill website, with data for each program at each year. We would like to also input data for default
      course selections for new users, where they will be able to input the standard 8-semester schedule from the site.
      More support will also be added for users with transfer credits, and improved security ventures will also be made
      to allow users to change their passwords given a confirmation email. In the future given a more complete set of
      courses, we would also like to add filters such that users can easily explore course options. Lastly, we have
      some aesthetic improvements in mind, particularly for pages that have fewer components such that they look more
      complete.
