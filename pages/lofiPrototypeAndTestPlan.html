            </b>
            <br><br>
            As an observer for today's user test session, you'll be tasked with recording, analyzing, and potentially
            helping the user as they navigate the McGill Course Tracker web application prototype according to a series
            of predefined tasks (see Tasks). You will follow a similar, if not the exact, course as written in the Test
            Script, and describe to the user their tasks with no more detail than what is given. You may not offer any
            additional assistance to the user or veer from this script unless it is clear that they are making no
            progress.
            <br><br>
            Please review the Data Collection document, which you will be filling out as you observe the user throughout
            this activity. There is a data collection document for each observed user. Note down any point which causes
            them difficulty and anything significant they say over the process. Add as many comments as you think
            necessary to sufficiently convey what the user has done. Ensure that the user has completed the pre-test
            questionnaire prior to starting the tasks and that they complete the post-test questionnaire afterwards.
            <br><br>
            Good luck!

                User Introduction
            </b>
            <br><br>
            You have agreed to be a test user in today's user test session for the McGill Course Tracker, a web
            application aimed towards McGill students, prospective students, and advisors to help track progress towards
            degree completion. You will be given a prototype to navigate according to a series of predefined tasks that
            will be explained to you by an observer with knowledge of how the system works. If you were unaware, please
            note that this prototype is fully functional, nor are you here to test its functionality. The prototype is
            meant to represent the user interface of the product, which you will be exploring. You will be recorded
            throughout the session, which will later be used for analytical purposes.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to ask the observer to clarify tasks if you have trouble understanding them, but do your best to
            refrain from asking questions about the system itself unless you are truly struggling. We encourage you to
            verbalize your thought process as you go through the prototype, but do not feel required to do so. Do not
            feel discouraged if you have trouble using the interface, as this exercise is meant to find things that can
            be improved about it.
            <br><br>
            Your input is valuable and we appreciate your time. Thank you, and good luck with the proceedings.

            This document is meant to explain to you, the user, all the information you will need to complete your
            tasks. During the test session, you are to evaluate the prototype provided to you by your observer/guide on
            our upcoming product, the McGill Course Tracker.
            <br><br>
            The McGill Course Tracker is a website meant to help current, incoming, and prospective students and
            academic advisors with course selection and tracking degree progression. Anyone can create an account on the
            website and use it for these purposes. The primary feature is a page where you can input courses that will
            then calculate your credits, needed credits, and both completed and incomplete requirements. Multiple course
            lists can be created and saved to your account to be used as reference.

            Hello! Welcome to the user testing session for the McGill Course Tracker website, meant to help current,
            prospective, and incoming students as well as advisors through course selection and determining degree
            progression. I'll be observing and guiding you through a set of tasks we have set out. You should know that
            you may withdraw consent for this study and exit at any time. If there is anything you're uncomfortable
            with, please let me know, and we will try to accommodate you. Please note that you will be recorded.
            <br><br>
            First of all, please confirm that you've completed the pre-test questionnaire. You should have been given it
            prior to today.
            <br><br>
            <i>[Wait for confirmation.]</i>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If completed: Excellent. Let's begin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If not completed: I have a copy of the questionnaire with me here. You can take the next 10 minutes
                    or so to fill it out.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <i>
                [With the questionnaire confirmed to be complete, show the prototype.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Today, youlll be evaluating one of these. This is a prototype user interface for the website. It is not
            completely functional, and I will be playing the part of acting out the system's expected behaviour. Feel
            free to ask questions if you're unclear on any of the tasks, but otherwise, you will go through each one
            without help, unless you're truly stuck.
            <br><br>
            We encourage you to verbalize your thoughts during this session, which will give us better insight into the
            user's experience.
            <br><br>
            Do you have any questions?
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [Wait for response. If none, continue. If there are, answer if you think it's appropriate.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Excellent. Let's begin.
            <br><br>
            There are 9 tasks planned for today. The first one is to create an account. Here's the homepage.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User creates account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Your second task is to log out of the account you just created.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User logs out of account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            And third, now log back in.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User logs back into account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Now, create a course list and input your courses.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User creates course list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Fifth, now that the list is complete, use it to calculate your credits and credits to completion.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User calculates credits.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Now use the same list to get all your unfulfilled course requirements.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User gets course requirements.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Great. Now for task seven, save this course list to your account.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User saves course list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            For task eight, I want you to access the course list you just saved.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User opens saved task list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            And now, lastly, for task nine, edit this course list and save the changes.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User edits the course list and saves.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Great! You're done. I'll stop the recording now. Do you need a break?
            <ul>

            Study description: Investigating whether ECSE students can access any information related to their degree.
            <br><br>
            Participant 1: Female U4 Software Engineering students, Annabelle's friend
            <br><br>
            Participant 2: Female athlete, Victoria's teammate
            <br><br>
            Participant 3: Still debating about the 3rd participant
            <br><br>
            Participants could encounter misinformation and confusion throughout the study. If the information found on
            the platform isn't accurate, it could lead to a conflict with the participant's graduation. These risks can
            be mitigated by a user-friendly interface and recent academic data.
