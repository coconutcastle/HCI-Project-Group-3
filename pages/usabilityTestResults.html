        <div class="text">
            After receiving feedback on our low-fidelity prototype, we have decided to make some significant changes.
            The first is regarding the scope of our project. We faced difficulty finding test users that were academic
            advisors,and considering how different the experiences are of students against advisors, this posed a large
            problem.By carefully considering our original pitch based on the struggles of students, we ultimately
            decided to remove academic advisors from our target group. We further reduced our scope to only ECSE current
            and incoming/prospective students based on the extremely varied degree structures across faculties and our
            group's greater access to engineering students. This narrower focus will allow us to deliver a
            higher-quality product to a more immediately available user group.
            <br><br>
            The following changes were made accordingly.
            <br><br>
            <b>Remove accommodation for degrees outside of the ECSE department.</b>
            <br><br>
            As part of the project scope reduction.
            <br><br>
            <b>Add “ECSE” to the landing page title.</b>
            <br><br>
            This makes it obvious to all new users that this tool is for McGill ECSE degrees.
            <br><br>
            <b>Add degree options directly to the curricula page.</b>
            <br><br>
            This is possible as the degree options have been reduced to those offered by the ECSE department. This will
            reduce the number of clicks needed to navigate the site.
            <br><br>
            <b>Add technical and humanities complementaries and a minor button to the curricula page.</b>
            <br><br>
            This will reduce the number of clicks needed to navigate the site.
            <br><br><br>
            We have also singled out some design elements unrelated to the scope reduction to modify based on the
            results of the user testing and updated usability goals (described in the next section).
            <br><br>
            <b>Add an “Update” button in the degree visualizer and make it immediately visible.</b>
            <br><br>
            Some test users took more time than expected to find how to update their progress, add courses or edit
            course details. Some tried scrolling to the bottom of the page, and others tried clicking on the relevant
            sections. To reduce confusion, we decided to add an “Update” button to the top of the degree visualizer so
            that it is one of the first things the user sees on this page. They then know to click this button in case
            they want to update their degree information.
            <br><br>
            <b>Change the name of the “Add Curricula” button to “View Degree Offerings”.</b>
            <br><br>
            This button is meant to allow the user to view and explore all available curricula. However, this name was
            clearly confusing to some users, many of whom asked what it meant and what it was supposed to do. The new
            name is more straightforward and directly describes what the button does.
            <br><br>
            <b>Add “Degree Visualizer” to the side menu.</b>
            <br><br>
            This reduces the number of clicks needed to get to the primary functionality of the site. Previously, the
            user needed to navigate through the “Profile” button.
            <br><br>
            <b>Reduce the amount of hidden functionality in the side menu.</b>
            <br><br>
            “Technical Complementaries' ', “Natural Science Complementaries”, “Humanities Complementaries” have been
            removed from the side menu and moved to the curricula page. When starting on the curricula page, users
            looked for these sections there first before clicking the side menu. These sections are similar enough in
            purpose to be bundled together, and it makes more logical sense to have it with the curricula
            descriptions/course offerings.
        </div>
        <div class="header2Text">Usability Goals</div>
        <div class="text">
            After check-in with our mentor, we decided to split our usability goals in 3 categories: Discoverability,
            Maintainability and User Satisfaction. Each goal contains sub-goals that are more technical and linked to
            the system features. It was also decided to scope down the target user to incoming and current McGill
            undergraduate ECSE students.
            <br><br>
            <b>Discoverability: </b>Upon initial use, users should easily access and use system components and
            functionalities.
            <ol>
                <li>The user should be able to visualize their course progression throughout their degree.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to find information about possible minors.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to access all degree course information.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to login and logout from their account.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to access curriculum information without an account.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to update their degree with minors.</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Reliability/Maintainability: </b>Information made available to the user should be up-to-date and
            accurate.
            <ol start="7">
                <li>The user should be able to identify which complementary courses are available.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to identify which courses are left to complete.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to keep their profile up to date with courses completed, and complementaries
                    selected.</li>
            </ol>
            <b>User Satisfaction: </b>The system should satisfy the user's requirements while being enjoyable and
            rewarding to use.
            <ol start="10">
                <li>The user should engage with the application with ease.</li>
                <li>The user should express comfort with using the system.</li>

            </b>
            <br><br>
            As an observer for today's user test session, you'll be tasked with recording, analyzing, and potentially
            helping the user as they navigate the McGill Course Tracker web application prototype according to a series
            of predefined tasks (see Tasks). You will follow a similar, if not the exact, course as written in the Test
            Script, and describe to the user their tasks with no more detail than what is given. You may not offer any
            additional assistance to the user or veer from this script unless it is clear that they are making no
            progress.
            <br><br>
            Please review the Data Collection document, which you will be filling out as you observe the user throughout
            this activity. There is a data collection document for each observed user. Note down any point which causes
            them difficulty and anything significant they say over the process. Add as many comments as you think
            necessary to sufficiently convey what the user has done. Ensure that the user has completed the pre-test
            questionnaire prior to starting the tasks and that they complete the post-test questionnaire afterwards.
            <br><br>
            Good luck!

                User Introduction
            </b>
            <br><br>
            You have agreed to be a test user in today's user test session for the McGill Course Tracker, a web
            application aimed towards McGill students, prospective students, and advisors to help track progress towards
            degree completion. You will be given a prototype to navigate according to a series of predefined tasks that
            will be explained to you by an observer with knowledge of how the system works. If you were unaware, please
            note that this prototype is fully functional, nor are you here to test its functionality. The prototype is
            meant to represent the user interface of the product, which you will be exploring. You will be recorded
            throughout the session, which will later be used for analytical purposes.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to ask the observer to clarify tasks if you have trouble understanding them, but do your best to
            refrain from asking questions about the system itself unless you are truly struggling. We encourage you to
            verbalize your thought process as you go through the prototype, but do not feel required to do so. Do not
            feel discouraged if you have trouble using the interface, as this exercise is meant to find things that can
            be improved about it.
            <br><br>
            Your input is valuable and we appreciate your time. Thank you, and good luck with the proceedings.

            <br><br>
            The McGill Course Tracker is a website meant to help current, incoming, and prospective students and
            academic advisors with course selection and tracking degree progression. Anyone can create an account on the
            website and use it for these purposes. The primary feature is a page where you can input courses that will
            then calculate your credits, needed credits, and both completed and incomplete requirements. Multiple course
            lists can be created and saved to your account to be used as reference.

            Hello! Welcome to the user testing session for the McGill Course Tracker website, meant to help current,
            prospective, and incoming students as well as advisors through course selection and determining degree
            progression. I'll be observing and guiding you through a set of tasks we have set out. You should know that
            you may withdraw consent for this study and exit at any time. If there is anything you're uncomfortable
            with, please let me know, and we will try to accommodate you. Please note that you will be recorded.
            <br><br>
            First of all, please confirm that you've completed the pre-test questionnaire. You should have been given it
            prior to today.
            <br><br>
            <i>[Wait for confirmation.]</i>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If completed: Excellent. Let's begin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If not completed: I have a copy of the questionnaire with me here. You can take the next 10 minutes
                    or so to fill it out.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <i>
                [With the questionnaire confirmed to be complete, show the prototype.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Today, youlll be evaluating one of these. This is a prototype user interface for the website. It is not
            completely functional, and I will be playing the part of acting out the system's expected behaviour. Feel
            free to ask questions if you're unclear on any of the tasks, but otherwise, you will go through each one
            without help, unless you're truly stuck.
            <br><br>
            We encourage you to verbalize your thoughts during this session, which will give us better insight into the
            user's experience.
            <br><br>
            Do you have any questions?
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [Wait for response. If none, continue. If there are, answer if you think it's appropriate.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Excellent. Let's begin.
            <br><br>
            There are 9 tasks planned for today. The first one is to create an account. Here's the homepage.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User creates account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Your second task is to log out of the account you just created.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User logs out of account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            And third, now log back in.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User logs back into account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Now, create a course list and input your courses.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User creates course list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Fifth, now that the list is complete, use it to calculate your credits and credits to completion.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User calculates credits.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Now use the same list to get all your unfulfilled course requirements.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User gets course requirements.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Great. Now for task seven, save this course list to your account.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User saves course list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            For task eight, I want you to access the course list you just saved.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User opens saved task list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            And now, lastly, for task nine, edit this course list and save the changes.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User edits the course list and saves.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Great! You're done. I'll stop the recording now. Do you need a break?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If yes: <i>[Give the user 5 minutes.] </i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If not: <i>[Continue on to post-test questionnaire.] </i>
                </li>
            </ul>
            I'd now like you to fill out this post-test questionnaire. Take as much time as you need, and ask me if
            you're confused about anything here.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User completes post-test questionnaire.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            And that's it! You're done for today. Thank you so much for your time. We'll send you the details of the
            website once everything has been completed. Have a good rest of your day!
