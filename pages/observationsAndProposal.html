            Our observations were taken through observing people in the academic advising offices. These included both

        <div class="text">
            Many McGill Undergraduate students have lots of questions about their degree program, ranging from whether
            they are taking the right courses toward graduation to obtaining a minor. A lot of the information is
            available on the McGill website however it is scattered across department-, faculty-, and university-level
            websites. Students and academic advisors need a better way of sharing and finding this information.

        <div class="text">
            The Proposed System:
            <br><br>
            An interactive web platform that can help students in the department of ECSE better navigate the information
            they need. Students looking to assess their progress towards obtaining their degree (ensuring they have
            taken the right courses and enough credits) or simply looking for additional information regarding their
            options for complementary courses will be interacting with the web platform.
            <br><br>
            Actor: Anna (Persona 2)
            <br><br>
            Intention:
            <br><br>
            Anna is planning to graduate next year but has started to become anxious over whether she has taken all the
            required courses. Having already made plans for what to do after graduating, she desperately does not want
            to have some missing or incorrect courses throwing everything into disarray with another semester. A search
            online has revealed the McGill Course Tracker website, which should allow her to input all her data and keep
            track of everything. Anna hopes that this will help her review all her courses and better plan her schedules
            in the coming semesters.
            <br><br>
            Main Scenario:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Anna opens the link to the home page and clicks the “Create an Account” button to start using the
                    platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Anna signs in with her email and creates a password.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the next page, Anna selects her major, her year, starting year, expected graduation date, and
                    leaves the minor option blank.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After her profile and details have been set, Anna confirms them and moves on to the next page, where
                    she enters all the courses she has taken so far, their semester, and her grade for the ones that
                    have been completed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upon confirming all these changes, the page shows her per-semester and cumulative GPA, total credits
                    completed, a list of courses that need to be retaken, and remaining required courses and credits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Anna clicks on her profile icon and selects the “Sign Out” option to exit the page, feeling
                    significantly more settled knowing that she is on the right track.

            <br><br>
            MyDegree is an interactive web-platform that allows students to track the courses they’ve taken against
            their program requirements. The platform determines how selected future courses will be used towards
            completing their degree requirements. It explores how the completed and future coursework could be applied
            towards another program at the university. It is not a registration tool.

            <br><br>
            The Degree Progress Report is a generated pdf that checks the requirements that are needed towards
            graduation in a degree program. Based on this automated review, it shows what requirements have already been
            completed, what requirements still need to be completed and what is currently in progress.
            <br><br>
            Why is our platform better?
            <br><br>
            The existing platforms are specific to each university. There is nothing out there at the moment that
            satisfies the needs of the current student population at McGill in ECSE. Our platform would allow for
            significant improvement on the current process for students to acquire important information regarding
            curriculums and available courses in addition to being able to track their degree progress. Students will be
            able to stay up to date with changes made to course delivery and curriculums over the years. Our platform
            will have the flexibility of being interactive so it will not simply be a webpage with information. Each
            student will be able to update their profile as they complete courses and degree requirements. Finally, the
            platform will also have a public element to it, allowing students interested in attending McGill to have a
            deeper understanding of the curriculum, course offerings and degree options (minors + complementary courses)
            which will be very valuable to them.

            <br><br>
            We are all U4 software engineering students with web development experience. Several classes of our
            curriculum required us to build a web platform and taught us agile development techniques. Annabelle just
            finished a 4-month internship as a full-stack web developer during which she gained database and management
            skills. Cecile has experience with data requests, web scraping, processing and spent her summer working as a
            full-stack developer. Victoria completed several internships as a software engineering intern. She has
            experience in project management work and is qualified to develop either frontend or backend. Based on the
            experiences and the skills of the team, we strongly believe that we can achieve this project in one
            semester. We expect the development of the backend and frontend to take approximately 30 hours of work, and
            testing, both for the system and user, to take around 15. Prototyping and design is expected to take around
            20 hours.
