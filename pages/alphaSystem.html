      Group 2 among other users provided excellent feedback for out prototype, which beyond just as simple evaluators,
      they could also provide input as test users considering our user population of ECSE students. However, some of it
      was unfortunately too complex to be satisfactorily implemented in the time remaining, and we focused on design
      changes that would improve the experience of the users using the web application.
      <br><br>
      <b>Consistency in the navigation buttons</b>
      <br><br>
      Group 2 suggested to implement consistency in the application buttons throughout the application to follow
      Nielsen's heuristics #3: User control and freedom. Therefore, all buttons of the system were revisited and
      modified.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Back button in the side-bar is incorporated to every page. Clicking this button will take the user to
          the previous page. Previous instances of this button were removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The side-bar icon was changed for a cross so that the user knows there's an interaction to make with this
          button to close the menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          A save button was added to the degree visualizer page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Discoverability of Common Features</b>
      <br><br>
      Some of our features required too many clicks to be viewed and seemed hidden to the user. It was also highlighted
      that button's labeling wasn't instantly clear and more commonly used terms should be used.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Manage Degree Options was changed to View Majors & Minors.
        </li>
        <li>
          The options in the new View Majors & Minors page are directly displayed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Overall Design of the Application</b>
      <br><br>
      Although our design was minimalistic, the monochrome design and lack of variation makes the user view all options
      with equal priority and makes it necessary to read through all options each time. As group 2 proposed, we choose a
      color palette, three different fonts and use them adequately to show the relative importance of each section and
      functionality.

      Our Alpha Prototype is a React frontend using the Vite.js framework and deployed using Netlify, a decision made to
      reduce
      implementation efforts for successive deliverables and the final system.
