          <b>Improve styling for the calendar-format course list.</b> At the moment, use of the calendar is rather
          jarring due to somewhat lacking transitions and borders.

      To gain further insight into our prototype and what can be improved, we intend on conducting two more user tests.
      While five would be ideal, we are also taking into account the limited time we have left to implement adjustments
      to the interface. We will follow the same user testing procedure as previously outlined in the “Computer
      Prototype” deliverable, with some small changes in response to Group 2's evaluation.
      <br><br>
      The following tasks will be added to the task list:
      <ul>
        <li>
          View courses in a semester.
        </li>
        <li>
          Access program information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Access minor information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Tasks 9 and 10 will be removed due to no longer being applicable to this version of the interface.

      In addition to the planned changes in the design evolution, there are still numerous things needed to complete the
      prototype, in addition to the support of a backend. These are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Add more functionality to the buttons meant to modify the state of the user's course list.</b> In
          particular, these are the “Add Semester” and “Add Course” buttons
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create a button that allows the user to view their incomplete course requirements.</b> This will take the
          place of the “View Program” button.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add pages to the “Programs” page.</b> While we are not certain we will be able to add support for the
          curricula corresponding to every year, we would like to allow users to view at least the most recent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Complete “Profile” page.</b> Allow user to view and edit their profile.
        </li>
      </ul>
