        <div class="text">
            After receiving feedback on our low-fidelity prototype, we have decided to make some significant changes.
            The first is regarding the scope of our project. We faced difficulty finding test users that were academic
            advisors,and considering how different the experiences are of students against advisors, this posed a large
            problem.By carefully considering our original pitch based on the struggles of students, we ultimately
            decided to remove academic advisors from our target group. We further reduced our scope to only ECSE current
            and incoming/prospective students based on the extremely varied degree structures across faculties and our
            group's greater access to engineering students. This narrower focus will allow us to deliver a
            higher-quality product to a more immediately available user group.
            <br><br>
            The following changes were made accordingly.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Remove accommodation for degrees outside of the ECSE department.</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    As part of the project scope reduction.
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Add “ECSE” to the landing page title.</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    This makes it obvious to all new users that this tool is for McGill ECSE degrees.
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Add degree options directly to the curricula page.</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    This is possible as the degree options have been reduced to those offered by the ECSE department.
                    This will reduce the number of clicks needed to navigate the site.
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Add technical and humanities complementaries and a minor button to the curricula page.</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    This will reduce the number of clicks needed to navigate the site.
                </ul>
            </ul>
            We have also singled out some design elements unrelated to the scope reduction to modify based on the
            results of the user testing and updated usability goals (described in the Usability Goals Section).
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Add an “Update” button in the degree visualizer and make it immediately visible.</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    Some test users took more time than expected to find how to update their progress, add courses or
                    edit course details. Some tried scrolling to the bottom of the page, and others tried clicking on
                    the relevant sections. To reduce confusion, we decided to add an “Update” button to the top of the
                    degree visualizer so that it is one of the first things the user sees on this page. They then know
                    to click this button in case they want to update their degree information.
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Change the name of the “Add Curricula” button to “Programs and Curricula”.</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    This button is meant to allow the user to view and explore all available curricula. However, this
                    name was clearly confusing to some users, many of whom asked what it meant and what it was supposed
                    to do. The new name is more straightforward and directly describes what the button does.
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Add “Degree Visualizer” to the side menu.</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    This reduces the number of clicks needed to get to the primary functionality of the site.
                    Previously, the user needed to navigate through the “Profile” button.
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Reduce the amount of hidden functionality in the side menu.</b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    “Technical Complementaries' ', “Natural Science Complementaries”, “Humanities Complementaries” have
                    been removed from the side menu and moved to the curricula page. When starting on the curricula
                    page, users looked for these sections there first before clicking the side menu. These sections are
                    similar enough in purpose to be bundled together, and it makes more logical sense to have it with
                    the curricula descriptions/course offerings.

        <div class="header2Text">User Population</div>
        <div class="text">
            The user population of this web application are current, incoming, and prospective McGill undergraduate ECSE
            students. In our initial observations, we saw that many students struggled and even faced significant
            graduation setbacks due to confusion regarding their degree requirements. From this, we originally defined
            three user segments and target groups. The first were current students, whose primary concern was to keep
            track of their degree progress while having the flexibility to explore others. The second was incoming and
            prospective students, who wanted a clear understanding and layout of the requirements of the degree they
            were interested in while accounting for any transfer credit. The third was academic advisors, who wanted
            flexibility and accuracy to assist students in their sessions. However, as stated in the previous section,
            we ultimately decided to reduce our scope for reasons previously explained mainly revolving around
            implementation feasibility, availability and preservation of quality. The usability test session will seek
            test users from the current user population, aiming to cover all year levels (incoming/prospective, U0, U1,
            U2, U3, U4) and programs of study (electrical, software, and computer engineering).
        </div>
        <div class="header2Text">Usability Goals</div>
        <div class="text">
            After check-in with our mentor, we decided to split our usability goals in 3 categories: Discoverability,
            Maintainability and User Satisfaction. Each goal contains sub-goals that are more technical and linked to
            the system features. It was also decided to scope down the target user to incoming and current McGill
            undergraduate ECSE students.
            <br><br>
            <b>Discoverability: </b>Upon initial use, users should easily access and use system components and
            functionalities.
            <ol>
                <li>The user should be able to visualize their course progression throughout their degree.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to find information about possible minors.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to access all degree course information.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to login and logout from their account.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to access curriculum information without an account.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to update their degree with minors.</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Reliability/Maintainability: </b>Information made available to the user should be up-to-date and
            accurate.
            <ol start="7">
                <li>The user should be able to identify which complementary courses are available.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to identify which courses are left to complete.</li>
                <li>The user should be able to keep their profile up to date with courses completed, and complementaries
                    selected.</li>
            </ol>
            <b>User Satisfaction: </b>The system should satisfy the user's requirements while being enjoyable and
            rewarding to use.
            <ol start="10">
                <li>The user should engage with the application with ease.</li>
                <li>The user should express comfort with using the system.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="header2Text">Usability Test Procedure</div>
        <div class="text">
            <b>Number of Examiners</b>
            <br><br>
            A test trial may be carried out by one or two examiners. Only one examiner will be in contact with the user
            while another will be responsible for the recording. An examiner can choose to conduct the test alone and
            set up the recording prior to interacting with the user. If this is the case, the examiner cannot stop the
            test at any time to make adjustments to the recording.
            <br><br>
            <b>Equipment</b>
            <br><br>
            Examiners will need adequate equipment to record the test: camera, microphones, tripod, smartphone, etc. A
            laptop will be required to access the computer prototype hosted on figma.com. The examiner should also have
            material to take notes.
            <br><br>
            <b>Computer Prototype Handling</b>
            <br><br>
            For proper use of the computer prototype, examiners can refer to the User Manual section. The examiner
            should follow the installation guide and access the prototype on figma before the user arrives.
            <br><br>
            <b>Procedure Instructions</b>
            <ol>
                <li>The examiner must come prepared for the test by reading the test material: observer briefing, user
                    manual, questionnaires, documents, etc.</li>
                <li>The examiner should set-up and start the recording.</li>
                <li>Examiners should introduce themselves and explain to the user what the test entails. (Refer to the
                    observer briefing, training document and user introduction.) </li>
                <li>The examiner should provide the consent form to the user and ensure that it is signed before going
                    any further.</li>
                <li>The examiner should provide the user with the Pre-Test Questionnaire and ensure that it is
                    completed.</li>
                <li>The examiner should go over the user manual with the user.</li>
                <li>The examiner can begin the test by reading the script and collecting data on the Data Collection
                    Sheet. Don’t forget to time each task. </li>
                <li>The examiner should provide the user with the Post-Test Questionnaire and ensure that it is
                    completed.</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Interaction with the User</b>
            <br><br>
            Examiners are tasked with recording, analyzing, and potentially helping the user as they navigate the McGill
            Course Tracker web application prototype. The examiner can follow the given Test Script or modify it but
            should keep the series of predefined tasks. They should describe to the user their tasks with no more detail
            than what is given. The examiner may not offer any additional assistance to the user or veer from this
            script unless it is clear that they are making no progress. Examiners can refer to the observer briefing
            section for more explanations.
            <br><br>
            <b>Avoidance</b>
            <br><br>
            In no case should examiners interrupt the test unless requested by the user. No additional hints or detail
            should be provided to the user in advance of a task. The examiners shouldn't help the user unless they are
            asked to or see that no progress is made. They shouldn’t give their personal opinion or pause the test while
            the user is handling the prototype. The examiner is expected to tell the task not to explain how to do it.
            <br><br>
            <b>Measurements</b>
            <br><br>
            Examiners can review the Data Collection document for information regarding the measurement. The examiner
            will be filling out the sheet as they observe the user throughout this test. Difficulties encountered by the
            user or comments over the process may be noted down on the sheet.
        </div>
        <div class="header2Text">Reporting</div>
        <div class="text">
            All observations made during the trial should be documented in the Data Collection document. Data should be
            separated according to tasks/goals and reflect their success. Recorded times and additional comments must be
            added to this sheet as well. All required documentation, including questionnaires and consent forms, must be
            returned and completed at the end of the trial. The team may use the recording to complete the datasheet.
            The video should show both the user and the prototype and the audio should contain all the questions and
            answers. The outcomes will be used to improve and test the prototype. It is especially important to document
            the failures occurred during the trial. The design team is expected to conduct the test with respect and
            professionalism. The imputed results are expected to be clear, accurate and reflect the usability
            evaluation.
        </div>
        <div class="header2Text">Usability Evaluation</div>
        <div class="text">
            This document gives the evaluation guidelines for the McGil Course Tracker web application. With
            consideration for the usability goals and purpose of the product, the evaluation will be made to the
            following usability design heuristics (for more information, see <a
                href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/'>Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability
                Heuristics</a>):
            <ul>
                <li><b>Visibility of system status: </b>Was the user able to easily stay informed on what the system was
                    currently doing?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: When the user saves their course list, can they see that the system is in the process of
                        saving?</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Match between system and the real world: </b>Does the system use language and concepts familiar
                    to the user?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Did the user understand the purpose of the “View Degree Offerings” button?</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>User control and freedom: </b>Did the user have control over the system operations?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Could the user identify and make use of “Cancel” buttons to halt a current system process?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Consistency and standards: </b>Is the system easy for the user to use and understand based on
                    familiarity with previously used systems?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Did the user immediately understand the layout of the degree visualizer?</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Aesthetic and minimalist design: </b>Is the interface straightforward and clean, such that there
                    is no irrelevant information shown?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex: Is the degree visualizer uncluttered, making all the information presented to the user easy
                        to digest?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            Each examiner will carefully monitor and observe the user’s interactions with the web application with
            reference to the five design criteria. It is expected that the user will go through the interface twice to
            gain familiarity with it, and the examiner should make observations for both runs. Note down any usability
            problems you identify. See the Usability Test Procedure document for more information on the test procedure,
            and the Reporting document to see how this information should be recorded.
            <br><br>
            Please be aware that each evaluation is independent and that examiners may not communicate to one another
            regarding the proceedings and findings of the tests they conducted. A debriefing session will be held when
            all evaluations have been completed where examiners may discuss results with members of the design team.
            Results will be aggregated during this session, where the list of core usability issues, the heuristics they
            violated, and their severity will be identified and finalized.

            As an observer for today's user test session, you'll be tasked with recording, analyzing, and potentially
            helping the user as they navigate the McGill Course Tracker web application prototype according to a series
            of predefined tasks (see Tasks). You will follow a similar, if not the exact, course as written in the Test
            Script, and describe to the user their tasks with no more detail than what is given. You may not offer any
            additional assistance to the user or veer from this script unless it is clear that they are making no
            progress.
            <br><br>
            Please review the Data Collection document, which you will be filling out as you observe the user throughout
            this activity. There is a data collection document for each observed user. Note down any point which causes
            them difficulty and anything significant they say over the process. Add as many comments as you think
            necessary to sufficiently convey what the user has done. Ensure that the user has completed the pre-test
            questionnaire prior to starting the tasks and that they complete the post-test questionnaire afterwards.

                User Introduction
            </b>
            <br><br>
            You have agreed to be a test user in today's user test session for the McGill Course Tracker, a web
            application aimed towards McGill students, prospective students, and advisors to help track progress towards
            degree completion. You will be given a prototype to navigate according to a series of predefined tasks that
            will be explained to you by an observer with knowledge of how the system works. If you were unaware, please
            note that this prototype is fully functional, nor are you here to test its functionality. The prototype is
            meant to represent the user interface of the product, which you will be exploring. You will be recorded
            throughout the session, which will later be used for analytical purposes.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to ask the observer to clarify tasks if you have trouble understanding them, but do your best to
            refrain from asking questions about the system itself unless you are truly struggling. We encourage you to
            verbalize your thought process as you go through the prototype, but do not feel required to do so. Do not
            feel discouraged if you have trouble using the interface, as this exercise is meant to find things that can
            be improved about it.
            <br><br>
            Your input is valuable and we appreciate your time. Thank you, and good luck with the proceedings.

            This document is meant to explain to you, the user, all the information you will need to complete your
            tasks. During the test session, you are to evaluate the prototype provided to you by your observer/guide on
            our upcoming product, the McGill Course Tracker.
            <br><br>
            The McGill Course Tracker is a website meant to help current, incoming, and prospective students and
            academic advisors with course selection and tracking degree progression. Anyone can create an account on the
            website and use it for these purposes. The primary feature is a page where you can input courses that will
            then calculate your credits, needed credits, and both completed and incomplete requirements. Multiple course
            lists can be created and saved to your account to be used as reference.

            Hello! Welcome to the user testing session for the McGill Course Tracker website, meant to help current,
            prospective, and incoming students as well as advisors through course selection and determining degree
            progression. I'll be observing and guiding you through a set of tasks we have set out. You should know that
            you may withdraw consent for this study and exit at any time. If there is anything you're uncomfortable
            with, please let me know, and we will try to accommodate you. Please note that you will be recorded.
            <br><br>
            First of all, please confirm that you've completed the pre-test questionnaire. You should have been given it
            prior to today.
            <br><br>
            <i>[Wait for confirmation.]</i>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If completed: Excellent. Let's begin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If not completed: I have a copy of the questionnaire with me here. You can take the next 10 minutes
                    or so to fill it out.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <i>
                [With the questionnaire confirmed to be complete, show the prototype.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Today, youlll be evaluating one of these. This is a prototype user interface for the website. It is not
            completely functional, and I will be playing the part of acting out the system's expected behaviour. Feel
            free to ask questions if you're unclear on any of the tasks, but otherwise, you will go through each one
            without help, unless you're truly stuck.
            <br><br>
            We encourage you to verbalize your thoughts during this session, which will give us better insight into the
            user's experience.
            <br><br>
            Do you have any questions?
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [Wait for response. If none, continue. If there are, answer if you think it's appropriate.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Excellent. Let's begin.
            <br><br>
            There are 9 tasks planned for today. The first one is to create an account. Here's the homepage.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User creates account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Your second task is to log out of the account you just created.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User logs out of account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            And third, now log back in.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User logs back into account.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Now, create a course list and input your current courses. If you don't have anything to input, you can add a
            random selection!
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User creates course list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Fifth, now that the list is complete, use it to calculate your credits and credits to completion.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User calculates credits.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Now use the same list to get all your unfulfilled course requirements.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User gets course requirements.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Great. Now for task seven, save this course list to your account.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User saves course list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            For task eight, I want you to access the course list you just saved.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User opens saved task list.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            And now, lastly, for task nine, edit this course list and save the changes.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User edits the course list and saves.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Great! You're done. I'll stop the recording now. Do you need a break?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If yes: <i>[Give the user 5 minutes.] </i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If not: <i>[Continue on to post-test questionnaire.] </i>
                </li>
            </ul>
            I'd now like you to fill out this post-test questionnaire. Take as much time as you need, and ask me if
            you're confused about anything here.
            <br><br>
            <i>
                [User completes post-test questionnaire.]
            </i>
            <br><br>
            And that's it! You're done for today. Thank you so much for your time. We'll send you the details of the
            website once everything has been completed. Have a good rest of your day!
